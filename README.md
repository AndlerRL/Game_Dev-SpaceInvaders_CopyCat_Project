<h6>About the Project:</h6>
<ul>
<li>Space Invaders Copy-Cat with a simple structure and controls witch have only 1 level and really, really basic AI.</li>
<li>The design, such as the UI has been personilized by me, but the assets, such as the spaceship, enemy's spaceship has been taken by another designer, such as the sfx, background, etc.</li>
<li>This project only demostrate my skills as JS dev and the interest to use it as a Game Dev... Honestly just passing a good time coding and having fun doing it.</li>
