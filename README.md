<h1>Game Dev â€“ SpaceInvaders Copy-cat project</h1>

<strong><code>v1.0.0</code></strong>

<p>Game into production! Game is now fully playable. It has now the ability to shoot and hit aliens, also some SFX has change for better quality. On each alien killed, you gain 10 points and also save the high score. Another changes has been made, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fonts has been changed to Orbitron, by Google Fonts.</li>
<li>Alien AI acelerate each time that a entire row has been killed.</li>
<li>Shooting is now a little bit faster.</li>
<li>A game over screen show high score and last score saved from local storage (Web storage).</li>
<li>UI/UX changed for better quality of the game. Simple, but fun! :)</li>
 </ul>

<strong><code>v0.8.2</code></strong>

<p>SFX, Animations mounted completely to the game. The game's enemy animation has a simple movement, where each time that the enemy goes to the bottom on the screen will go to the top until all of them will destroyed. After all enemies are destroyed, it will return, but faster.</p>

<p>It's true to say that there's no collission, put will do further. Other fixes such as load screen has been re-positioned and relocated SFX files properly.</p>

<strong><code>v0.3.5b</code></strong>

<p>On this version, added almost all the space-ship animations, such as movements. Since the game has the Space-Ship rendered, it can be move through clicks on the game screen or with the assigned key-binds as it shows on the UI. Shoots animations and SFX has not yet added to the game, but will do later.</p>

<p>Code has been cleaned; less code comments and console.log/debug commented.</p>

<strong><code>v0.2.1a</code></strong>

<p>On this version of the project I created 2 animations, witch the 1st is the background created by keyframes, simulating the outer-space movement and the other has a combine animation functions, such as keyframes and pure JS (with setTimeout) for the iterations of differents screens that simulates the loading screen on the canvas, so at the time the game loaded properly, will be closed.</p>

<strong><code>v0.1.0a</code></strong>

<p>This is a basic project that demostrate the use of HTML5, CSS3 & JS (with ES5) to create a game, all rendered with pure JS and some libs, such as createjs.</p>

<h4>About the Project:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Space Invaders Copy-Cat with a simple structure and controls witch have only 1 level and really, really basic AI.</li>
<li>The design, such as the UI has been personilized by me, but the assets, such as the spaceship, enemy's spaceship has been taken by another designer, such as the sfx, background, etc.</li>
<li>This project only demostrate my skills as JS dev and the interest to use it as a Game Dev... Honestly just passing a good time coding and having fun doing it.</li>
</ul>
