<h1>Game Dev â€“ SpaceInvaders Copy-cat project</h1>

<strong><code>v0.1.0a</code></strong>

<p>This is a basic project that demostrate the use of HTML5, CSS3 & JS (with ES5) to create a game, all rendered with pure JS and some libs, such as createjs.</p>

<strong><code>v0.2.1a</code></strong>

<p>On this version of the project I created 2 animations, witch the 1st is the background created by keyframes, simulating the outer-space movement and the other has a combine animation functions, such as keyframes and pure JS (with setTimeout) for the iterations of differents screens that simulates the loading screen on the canvas, so at the time the game loaded properly, will be closed.</p>

<strong><code>v0.3.5b</code></strong>

<p>On this version, added almost all the space-ship animations, such as movements. Since the game has the Space-Ship rendered, it can be move through clicks on the game screen or with the assigned key-binds as it shows on the UI. Shoots animations and SFX has not yet added to the game, but will do later.</p>

<p>Code has been cleaned; less code comments and console.log/debug commented.</p>

<li>Space Invaders Copy-Cat with a simple structure and controls witch have only 1 level and really, really basic AI.</li>
<li>The design, such as the UI has been personilized by me, but the assets, such as the spaceship, enemy's spaceship has been taken by another designer, such as the sfx, background, etc.</li>
<li>This project only demostrate my skills as JS dev and the interest to use it as a Game Dev... Honestly just passing a good time coding and having fun doing it.</li>
